  AllPapers:
  - Jane Doe lied, and then she died. She didn't know where Greece is, so the boy
    sawed her to pieces. Buried the bits in the backwoods, thus spoke no more falsehoods.
  - Mortified by his deed, the boy's time was to cede, his fate he could foresee,
    bloated, hanging from a tree, he wanted to stay strung, though his tale went unsung.
  - One drink too many, I doubt he should have taken any, the burning you could smell,
    when he drove them right to hell, enjoy the ride, take a breath, for soon it will
    end in your untimely death.
  - Was it a hitchhiker or was it a ghost? Dear passenger, this is your goalpost,
    i guess your scream was one too many, now you're dead at no more than twenty.
  - The backseat party animal himself, you had the chance, oh no but you had to dance,
    drive my friend, take a risk! What's lodged in your skull? A compact disc.
  - The quiet one, I assume. This one night you let yourself bloom. Instead of being
    timid you wanted to stray. Who's eating your eyeball, a bird of prey?
