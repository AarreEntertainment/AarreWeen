  - Hi, I just read those tweets they're making about you. Some of those are really
    mean. So sorry, man. Don't let them get inside your head. You can always go back
    to your studies.
  - Dude, someone just posted a video of 9 year old you in blackface, from the Tiernapojat
    play. No use in explaining that in Finland you had to wear the makeup.
  - They broke another window. Your sister's so afraid she wet her bed again. Are
    you all right? Worried about you. You shouldn't do that streaming stuff anymore.
    I love you. Mom.
  - You're being compared to the vampire castle guy. I hope you're all right. Some
    old chat log got leaked again. They say you made an ableist slur in it. I think
    it's Maria. She's been dismissing you in several posts.
  - 'I ran into the biggest woke streamer in a dating app and he turned out to be
    a huge transphobe.
